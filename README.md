JavaScript Array Functions Project

Welcome to my JavaScript Array Functions Project 👋

This repository provides hands-on examples of commonly used JavaScript array methods with clear explanations in comments.
It’s perfect for beginners and intermediate learners who want to strengthen their understanding of arrays in JavaScript.

📂 Project Overview

This project covers the following array method categories:

🔹 Adding & Removing

push(), pop(), unshift(), shift(), splice(), slice()

🔹 Searching

indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), includes(), find(), findIndex()

🔹 Iteration & Transformation

forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce(), some(), every()

🔹 Other Useful Methods

sort(), reverse(), concat(), join(), flat(), flatMap()

Each method is explained with:

✅ Code Example

📖 Commented Theory (what it does, how it works, and when to use it)

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-array-functions.git

2️⃣ Open the Project
cd js-array-functions

3️⃣ Run the Examples

Using Node.js:

node index.js


Or directly open the file in your browser console.

📖 Example Snippet
// push() → Adds elements to the end of the array
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
fruits.push("Mango");
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]

// 📘 Theory: push() modifies the original array and is useful
// when adding new items at the end.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

By working through this project, you will:

Understand the difference between mutating (changes the original) and non-mutating (returns new array) methods.

Learn how to add, remove, search, transform, and combine arrays effectively.

Gain confidence writing clean, practical JavaScript code.

🛠️ Tech Stack
