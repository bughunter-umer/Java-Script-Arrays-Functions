# 📘 JavaScript Array Functions Project

Welcome to my **JavaScript Array Functions Project** 👋

This repository contains practical examples of **JavaScript array methods** along with theoretical explanations inside comments. It’s designed for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand how different array functions work in real projects.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of:

* **Adding/Removing Methods** (`push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, `splice`, `slice`)
* **Searching Methods** (`indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `includes`, `find`, `findIndex`)
* **Iteration & Transformation Methods** (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`)
* **Other Array Methods** (`sort`, `reverse`, `concat`, `join`, `flat`, `flatMap`)

Each method is explained with:

1. **Code Example**
2. **Commented Theory** (what it does, how it works, and when to use it)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-array-functions.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd js-array-functions
   ```
3. Open `index.js` (or whichever file contains the examples) in your favorite code editor.
4. Run the code using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   or simply open in **browser console** for instant testing.

## 📖 Example Snippet

```js
// push() → Adds elements to the end of the array
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
fruits.push("Mango");
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]

// Theory: push() modifies the original array and is useful when adding new items at the end.
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Understand the difference between **mutating** (changes original) and **non-mutating** (returns new) methods.
* Learn how to **add, remove, search, transform, and combine** arrays.
* Write clean, practical JavaScript code with proper comments.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Node.js** (for execution)
